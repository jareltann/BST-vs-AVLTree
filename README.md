# BST vs AVL Tree

Comparing two different BSTs, T1 and T2

T1 is "tall and skinny" while T2 is an AVL tree

Between T1 and T2, I compared:

- Height
- Average Insertion Time
- Average Key Depth
- Min, Max, and Average Times for Membership Checks
- Min, Max and Average Depths of Search for the Membership Checks
